# TODOs from session (2025-12-03)

1. Run importer dry-run on ExerciseDatabase and produce anomaly report (read-only). Save report to docs/analysis/import-dry-run-report-YYYYMMDD.json  (high)
2. Ensure tests run against isolated DB (configure in-memory SQLite for pytest) and re-run full test suite until all tests pass  (high)
3. Add idempotency and checksum uniqueness tests; ensure importer handles IntegrityError gracefully  (high)
4. Implement generator CLI that calls FastAPI by exercise IDs, assembles LaTeX, and builds PDF (minimal template)  (medium)
5. Create minimal LaTeX template (preamble, exercise environment) with LaTeX expert input  (medium)
6. Request peer code review for models, API contract, and importer logic (share PRD + key files)  (high)
7. Draft README and quickstart docs for developer workflow (install, run API, import dry-run, generator CLI, run tests)  (medium)
8. Set up CI (GitHub Actions) to run pytest and optionally attempt a sample LaTeX build on push to main  (medium)
9. Contact teaching colleague to validate student persona and sample exercises (vocational contexts)  (low)
10. Plan next development session: decide which task to start (import dry-run recommended)  (low)
