MVP (Core Functionalities) — To_Exercises

Goal: Deliver the core features needed for a usable product while respecting the team's development philosophy (tests-first, DoD enforcement, minimal waste).

1) Core CRUD for Exercises (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Acceptance Criteria:
- POST /exercises creates a new exercise and returns 200 with an `id`.
- GET /exercises/{id} returns the created exercise or 404 if missing.
- PUT /exercises/{id} updates mutable fields and returns the updated object.
- DELETE /exercises/{id} removes the exercise and subsequent GET returns 404.
- Tests: tests/test_api.py::test_crud_roundtrip passes end-to-end.

2) Basic Querying / Filtering

Acceptance Criteria:
- GET /exercises supports query params: `tag`, `difficulty_min`, `module` and returns matching results.
- Query results are JSON arrays of Exercise objects.
- Tests: query step in test_crud_roundtrip returns at least one matching result.

3) Checksum Uniqueness / Duplicate Protection

Acceptance Criteria:
- The `checksum` field is unique at DB level (unique index).
- Creating a second exercise with the same checksum fails (HTTP 400/422/500) and no duplicate record is created.
- Tests: tests/test_api.py::test_checksum_uniqueness asserts failure on duplicate creation.

4) Local Dev Experience: run & test

Acceptance Criteria:
- `uvicorn to_exercises.main:app --reload` starts the app (as described in README).
- `pytest` runs tests successfully in a clean environment.
- README instructions are accurate for local setup.

Optional (stretch):
5) CI Pipeline with test & lint gates

Acceptance Criteria:
- CI workflow installs dependencies and runs `pytest`.
- Failures in tests block merges to protected branches (when CI is enabled).

Notes:
- Keep stories vertical: each acceptance criteria must be backed by an automated test before a story is accepted.
- Enforce Definition of Done: unit/acceptance test, passing CI, minimal docs, and updated changelog/README when behavior changes.
