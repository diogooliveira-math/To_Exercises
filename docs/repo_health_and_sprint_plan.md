Repo Health Summary — To_Exercises

Health Check
- Project: FastAPI + SQLModel + SQLite
- Main app: src/to_exercises/main.py
- Models: src/to_exercises/models.py
- CRUD: src/to_exercises/crud.py
- DB: src/to_exercises/database.py (sqlite:///./to_exercises.db)
- Tests: tests/test_api.py (uses TestClient)
- Requirements: requirements.txt

Key Risks
- No CI found (no GitHub Actions or similar workflows) — CI gating not enforced.
- Persistent SQLite file used during tests; consider switching to in-memory DB for tests to avoid state bleed.
- No linters or pre-commit hooks detected.
