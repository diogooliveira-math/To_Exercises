# API Contracts (generated)

This document summarizes the API surface for To_Exercises (generated by document-project targeted scan).

## Endpoints

- POST /v1/exercises/
  - Request model: Exercise (see models.md)
  - Behavior: Upsert by checksum. Returns 201 or 200 with Exercise model. Returns 400 if checksum missing.
  - Error cases: 400 (checksum required), 409 (conflict on apply, not currently implemented in API but expected by PRD)

- GET /v1/exercises/{exercise_id}
  - Returns Exercise or 404 if not found.

- GET /v1/exercises/
  - Query params: limit (default 50), offset (default 0)
  - Returns list of Exercises.


## OpenAPI

The app exposes automatic OpenAPI at /openapi.json and docs at /docs (FastAPI default).


Notes:
- Response models are SQLModel-based and include created_at/updated_at timestamps in ISO8601 UTC.
- Ensure contract tests assert duplicate/import semantics return expected status codes (e.g., 409 on conflict with conflict_id payload).
